## ‚ú® Features

- **IP Address Encryption**: Securely encrypt IP addresses using industry-standard algorithms.
- **Obfuscation Techniques**: Hide your IP address to protect your privacy.
- **Format-Preserving Encryption**: Maintain the original format of the IP address during encryption.
- **Multiple Encryption Modes**: Support for AES-ECB and AES-XTS modes.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works seamlessly across different platforms that support Dart.

## üöÄ Installation

To get started with IPCrypt, you need to add it to your Dart project. You can do this by adding the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  ipcrypt: ^1.0.0
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
dart pub get
```

## üîç Usage

Using IPCrypt is simple. Here‚Äôs a basic example to get you started:

```dart
import 'package:ipcrypt/ipcrypt.dart';

void main() {
  final ipCrypt = IPCrypt();

  // Encrypt an IP address
  String encryptedIP = ipCrypt.encrypt('192.168.1.1');
  print('Encrypted IP: $encryptedIP');

  // Decrypt the IP address
  String decryptedIP = ipCrypt.decrypt(encryptedIP);
  print('Decrypted IP: $decryptedIP');
}
```

This example demonstrates how to encrypt and decrypt an IP address using the library.

## üîí Encryption Methods

IPCrypt supports several encryption methods to ensure the highest level of security:

### AES-ECB

AES-ECB (Advanced Encryption Standard in Electronic Codebook mode) is a symmetric key encryption method. It is straightforward but may not be suitable for all use cases due to its predictability.

### AES-XTS

AES-XTS (XEX-based tweaked-codebook mode with ciphertext stealing) is a more secure option. It is designed for encrypting data on storage devices and provides better security against certain attacks.

## üìö Examples

### Encrypting an IP Address

To encrypt an IP address, you can use the following code snippet:

```dart
String encryptedIP = ipCrypt.encrypt('203.0.113.195');
print('Encrypted IP: $encryptedIP');
```

### Decrypting an IP Address

To decrypt an encrypted IP address, use:

```dart
String decryptedIP = ipCrypt.decrypt(encryptedIP);
print('Decrypted IP: $decryptedIP');
```
